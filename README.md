# Web3-Simple-storage
This code is a Python script that interacts with an Ethereum smart contract called SimpleStorage. The script uses the Solidity compiler to compile the smart contract code and generate the Application Binary Interface (ABI) and bytecode. The ABI is a JSON file that describes the functions and variables of the smart contract, while the bytecode is the compiled code that can be deployed to the Ethereum network.
The script then connects to the Ethereum network using the Web3 library and Infura's API. Infura is a Web3 backend and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider that offers a range of services and tools for blockchain developers, The script deploys the SimpleStorage smart contract to the network and interacts with it by calling its functions.
